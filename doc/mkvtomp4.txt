NAME
====

mkvtomp4 - convert H.264 mkv files to mp4 files playable on the PS3

SYNOPSIS
========

mkvtomp4 [OPTIONS] [--] <mkvfile>

mkvtomp4 --correct-profile-only [--] <rawh264file>

DESCRIPTION
===========

Uses mpeg4ip or GPAC's MP4Box, mkvtoolnix and ffmpeg to convert
troublesome mkv files to mp4. The conversion does not re-encode the
video and only re-encodes the audio if it doesn't use AAC codec (one can
override this behaviour using --audio-codec). They will be playable on
the Sony PS3.

We depend on: mkvtoolnix, mpeg4ip or GPAC's MP4Box for the conversion.
ffmpeg is optional but required for audio transcoding.

OPTIONS
=======

--use-mp4creator, --use-mp4box
    Specify which mp4 backend to use. mp4creator is the default.
