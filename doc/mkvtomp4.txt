NAME


mkvtomp4.py - convert H.264 mkv files to mp4 files playable on the PS3



SYNOPSIS


_mkvtomp4.py_ OPTIONS [--] <mkvfile>

_mkvtomp4.py_ --correct-profile-only [--] <rawh264file>



DESCRIPTION


Uses existing tools to convert troublesome mkv files to mp4. The
conversion does not re-encode the video and only re-encodes the audio if
it doesn’t use AAC codec (one can override this behaviour using
--audio-codec). The resulting mp4 will be playable on the Sony PS3.

We depend on: _mkvtoolnix_, _mpeg4ip_ or GPAC’s _MP4Box_ for the
conversion. _ffmpeg_ is optional but required for audio transcoding.



OPTIONS


-o, --output=<outfile>
    Put the completed mp4 into <outfile>.

--keep-temp-files
    Keep all temporary files created while converting.

-v, --verbose
    Print info about what is happening.

-n, --dry-run
    Don’t run any commands, but print them in a shellquoted format that
    can be safely copy-pasted by the user.

--use-mp4creator, --use-mp4box, --use-ffmpeg
    Specify which mp4 backend to use. mp4box is the default.

--mp4creator=<mp4creator>
    Use <mp4creator> as the mp4creator command.

--mp4box=<mp4box>
    Use <mp4box> as the mp4box command.

--ffmpeg=<ffmpeg>
    Use <ffmpeg> as the ffmpeg command.

--mkvinfo=<mkvinfo>
    Use <mkvinfo> as the mkvinfo command.

--mkvextract=<mkvextract>
    Use <mkvextract> as the mkvextract command.

--video-track=<video_track>
    Use <video_track> from the mkv file instead of trying to parse it.

--audio-track=<audio_track>
    Use <audio_track> from the mkv file instead of trying to parse it.

--audio-delay-ms=<delay_ms>
    When importing the audio track, delay by <delay_ms> milliseconds.
    e.g., --audio-delay-ms=1000 delays by 1 second. Only supported by
    mp4box.

--audio-bitrate=<bitrate>
    If/When converting audio, use the given bitrate. e.g., 128.

--audio-channels=<channels>
    If/When converting audio, use <channels> channels in the output.
    e.g., 5.1.

--audio-codec=<codec>
    If/When converting audio, convert to <codec>. Default is aac. This
    should be something supported by _ffmpeg_.

--correct-profile-only
    Only correct the profile

--stop-before-extract-video
    Exit before extracting video from <mkvfile>.

--stop-before-correct-profile
    Exit before correcting profile of raw H.264 stream.

--stop-before-extract-audio
    Exit before extracting audio from <mkvfile>.

--stop-before-convert-audio
    Exit before converting audio previously extracted. This will stop
    even if the audio does not need to be converted.

--stop-before-video-mp4
    Exit before adding the extracted video to the mp4 container.

--stop-before-hinting-mp4
    Exit before hinting the mp4 file with the video track.

--stop-before-audio-mp4
    Exit before adding the extracted (and possibly converted) audio to
    the mp4 container.

<mkvfile>
    The Matroska (.mkv) file you wish to convert.

<rawh264file>
    The raw H.264 stream file that will have its profile corrected for
    use on the PS3.
