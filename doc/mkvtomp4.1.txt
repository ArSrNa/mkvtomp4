MKVTOMP4(1)
===========


NAME
-----
mkvtomp4 - convert H.264 mkv files to mp4 files playable on the PS3


SYNOPSIS
--------
*mkvtomp4* ['OPTIONS'] [--] '<mkvfile>'

*mkvtomp4* *--correct-profile-only* [--] '<rawh264file>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Uses mpeg4ip, mkvtoolnix and ffmpeg to convert troublesome mkv files to mp4.
The conversion does not re-encode the video and only re-encodes the audio if
it doesn't use AAC codec (one can override this behaviour using
*--audio-codec*). They will be playable on the Sony PS3.

We depend on: *mkvtoolnix*, *mpeg4ip* for the conversion. *ffmpeg* is optional
but required for audio transcoding.

    If/When converting audio, use the given bitrate. e.g., '128'.

*--audio-codec*='<codec>'::

    should be something supported by *ffmpeg*.
