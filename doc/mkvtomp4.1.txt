# NAME

mkvtomp4.py - convert H.264 mkv files to mp4 files playable on the PS3


# SYNOPSIS

*mkvtomp4.py* [OPTIONS] [\--] \<mkvfile>

*mkvtomp4.py* \--correct-profile-only [\--] \<rawh264file>

*mkvtomp4.py* \--print-profile-only [\--] \<rawh264file>


# DESCRIPTION

Uses existing tools to convert troublesome mkv files to mp4,
that is playable on the PS3.
The conversion does not re-encode H.264 video.
If the H.264 profile level is not supported by the PS3,
we rewrite just some profile level information.
The default value is 4.1, but it can be set with `--profile-level=4.0`, etc.
The conversion only re-encodes audio if it doesn't already use AAC.
The resulting mp4 will be playable on the Sony PS3, and similar devices.
Tested on profile levels 3.x and 4.x,

Note that the PS4 Media Player has better support for mkv than mp4
(subtitles work only on mkv).

We depend on: *mkvtoolnix* and GPAC's *MP4Box* for the conversion.
*ffmpeg* is only required if doing audio transcoding and subtitles.
